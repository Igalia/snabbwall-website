      <description>We have completed the sixth and final development milestone of SnabbWall, which is to upstream the app to the main Snabb repository.
With this update, we have moved the official Snabbwall branch to Igalia/snabb on Github in the snabbwall branch. Any further updates will be made to this branch and will be periodically upstreamed to the snabbco/snabb repository.
There is a blog post with a few more details here. Thanks to the NLNet Foundation for sponsoring this project!</description>

      <description>We have completed the fifth and penultimate development milestone of SnabbWall. This milestone consists of writing user documentation along with some testing and benchmarking.
On the documentation side, we now have a user guide document aimed at people who are familiar with Snabb and are interested in setting up a firewall with SnabbWall. Please let us know if you have any feedback about the documentation.
For testing and benchmarking, you can check out the tests directory in our Github repository.</description>

      <description>Igalian Asumu Takikawa has completed the next development milestone of SnabbWall. This means that the L7fw application is now available, as well as a snabb wall filter command, which can be readily used. With these additions, the fourth development milestone of our development roadmap is now completed. Make sure to check out Asumu&amp;rsquo;s complete writeup about the new features.
We have also started using the project wiki to write down some technical information for developers wanting to use the SnabbWallcomponents in their Snabb applications, or looking into contributing to the project.</description>

      <description>After a small hiatus, work on SnabbWallis progressing steadily again: the L7Spy Snabb application and the snabb wall spy command, which can be used to scan network traffic and detect L7 data flows, have landed in the repository. Our main developer has written a lengthy post about these features, which completes the third milestone of the development roadmap.
The ljndpi FFI binding has received updates as well. Starting with version 0.</description>
