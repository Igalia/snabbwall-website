This document is a high-level guide that describes how to use <span class="appname">SnabbWall</span>
to set up a basic firewall. See the [design]({{< ref "design.md" >}}) page for background on the basic
philosophy and design of <span class="appname">SnabbWall</Span>.

## Use-case

This guide will use a concrete use-case to illustrate how one might set up a
<span class="appname">SnabbWall</Span> deployment.
Imagine that you are running a public network, maybe a cafe hotspot or a corporate guest network,
and wish to block Bittorrent traffic to save on bandwidth.

To simplify the setup, we will start with a program that simulates this network activity
by reading and writing packet capture files (in pcap format). Near the end, the
document explains what aspects need to change in order to run the firewall with real
network interfaces.

The diagram below from the design page shows a typical <span class="appname">SnabbWall</Span>
configuration.

{{< figure src="/images/diagrams/arch-blocks.png" caption="Building blocks" >}}

The <span class="appname">Snabbwall</span> suite comes with two main apps:
[`L7Spy`]({{< ref "design.md#l7-spy" >}}) (a packet scanner)
and [`L7Fw`]({{< ref "design.md#l7-firewall" >}}) (a firewall). As you can
see above, the scanner app consumes and scans packets coming into the program
(e.g., from a NIC, a pcap reader, or any other app).

In a simple setup, the scanner forwards packets to the firewall app. The firewall consults the
data from the scanner and can make forwarding decisions, based on a set of firewall rules.

The firewall app drops packets as necessary according to the firewall rules and
forwards the rest to the next app. For example, in the diagram above the firewall sends packets
out to another NIC.

## Installation

Before getting into the configuration details, let's quickly go over how to obtain a copy of
Snabbwall. (Feel free to move on to the next section if you've already installed it)

For this guide, you will want to obtain a source code distribution from the
Github [releases](https://github.com/aperezdc/snabb/releases) page. To build Snabbwall, just
unpack the source code archive and run `make` in the unpacked directory.

You will also need to obtain and build a copy of the [nDPI](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI)
library either through your operating system's package manager or via Github.
Snabbwall will work with nDPI [v1.8](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI/releases/tag/1.8)
(the newest version as of March 2017). The instructions for building nDPI are in the linked
Github README.

Note: depending on where you install nDPI, you may need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when running
a Snabbwall program to ensure that it can load `libndpi.so` via the LuaJIT FFI.

## First steps

To create a runnable firewall, we need to make a Snabb program (a program is a set of Snabb apps that
are configured to solve a task). If you're not familiar with Snabb programs, you may
benefit from also reading Snabb's [Getting Started](https://github.com/snabbco/snabb/blob/master/src/doc/getting-started.md)
document.

Here is a barebones firewall program module. To make this runnable,
name the file `example_firewall.lua` and put it in the `src/program/example_firewall`
directory of your <span class="appname">Snabbwall</span> distribution.

```lua
-- example_firewall.lua

module(..., package.seeall)

-- basic module imports
local raw  = require("apps.socket.raw")
local pcap = require("apps.pcap.pcap")
local spy  = require("apps.wall.l7spy")
local fw   = require("apps.wall.l7fw")
local ndpi = require("apps.wall.scanner.ndpi")

-- configuration parameters for the l7fw
-- replace these with the appropriate values for your firewall host
-- for testing purposes, any values are ok
local host_ip  = "192.168.0.1"
local host_mac = "01:23:45:67:89:ab"

function run (args)
   -- an nDPI scanner instance for l7spy and l7fw
   local s = ndpi:new()

   -- configuration of the Snabb app network
   local c = config.new()

   -- a very basic rules table
   local rules = { default = "accept" }

   -- configuration table for l7fw
   local fw_config = { scanner = s,
                       rules = rules,
                       local_ipv4 = host_ip,
                       local_mac = host_mac }

   config.app(c, "net1", pcap.PcapReader, args[1])
   config.app(c, "net2", pcap.PcapWriter, args[2])

   config.app(c, "scanner", spy.L7Spy, { scanner = s })
   config.app(c, "firewall", fw.L7Fw, fw_config)

   config.link(c, "net1.output -> scanner.south")
   config.link(c, "scanner.north -> firewall.input")
   config.link(c, "firewall.output -> net2.input")
   config.link(c, "firewall.reject -> net2.input")

   engine.configure(c)

   -- run for 5 seconds and show the app reports
   engine.main({duration=5, report = { showapps=true }})
end
```

Let's walk through this step-by-step. At the top, we have several module imports
and some constant definitions like the IP of the router host called `host_ip`.

The main part of the program is the `run` function, which is called by the Snabb
framework when the program is invoked.

The `run` function first sets up several definitions. The `s` variable is the
packet scanner that our instances of `L7Spy` and `L7Fw` will use. The `c` variable
is the configuration of the Snabb program.

The `rules` definition is the table of firewall rules. For now, it's defined to
accept all packets. We'll update this later.

The `fw_config` table stores the configuration for the `L7Fw` app, which takes
several configuration arguments. It's recommended to fill out the `local_ipv4`
(and/or `local_ipv6`) and `local_mac` fields, which are used to send out responses
in case of a `reject` policy.

The `rules` and `scanner` keys are also mandatory.

The `config.app` and `config.link` lines are setting up the app network for this
Snabb program. This is also pretty straightforward. The first four lines instantiate
the four apps in our app network with their configurations.

The six link lines set up the connections between the apps. The `net1` app pulls
in packets from the "network interface" (though it's just a file for now), and
pushes them into the `scanner` app's south end.

The `scanner` pushes packets from its south end to its north end and vice versa.
The north end in this case is connected to the firewall, so packets get pushed to
the firewall after exiting the scanner.

After going through the firewall, the packets are pushed to the `net2` network
interface. There are two output links for the firewall, in case you need to
distinguish forwarded packets from the firewall (on `output`)
and error responses that are constructed by the firewall (on `reject`).

## Running the firewall

To run the firewall, first recompile Snabb (`make` in the top-level directory)
and then invoke it as:

```
sudo ./snabb example_firewall <input_file>.pcap <output_file>.pcap
```

supplying appropriate pcap file paths. There are many test pcap files available
in `src/program/wall/tests/data`.

Note: you need to have `libndpi` installed to use the packet scanner.
See the installation instructions from earlier for obtaining nDPI. Without it,
you may see an error like the following:

```
ndpi/c.lua:73: libndpi.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

After running the example program, you should see a report that looks similar to this:

```
apps report:
l7fw
Accepted packets: 17 (100%)
Rejected packets: 0 (0%)
Dropped packets:  0 (0%)
```

The actual number of accepted packets will depend on the pcap file that you use.

## Using non-trivial firewall rules

The firewall rules that we are using now are not very interesting. Let's go back to
our Bittorrent scenario and consider what is needed to support that.

The firewall rules are specified using a Lua table whose keys are protocol names
(or `"default"`) and whose values are strings which describe particular policies for
that protocol.

For example, to specify that Bittorrent traffic should be blocked entirely, change
the `local rules = ...` line above to the following:

```lua
local rules = { BITTORRENT = "drop",
                default = "accept" }
```

Now we can run the example program on some example Bittorrent traffic to test
the rules:

```
sudo ./snabb example_firewall\
  program/wall/tests/data/BITTORRENT.pcap output.pcap
```

You should see a report with the following numbers:

```
apps report:
l7fw
Accepted packets: 0 (0%)
Rejected packets: 0 (0%)
Dropped packets:  53 (100%)
```

The firewall rules can also be more sophisticated. The right-hand sides of the key-value
pairs can be a string that describes a [pfmatch](https://github.com/Igalia/pflua/blob/master/doc/pfmatch.md)
program.

For example, here is a rule that only drops Bittorrent flows if there are at least 5
packets in the flow and the destination IP address is `10.10.10.22`:

```lua
local rules = { BITTORRENT = [[match { flow_count >= 5 and
                                         dst net 10.10.10.22
                                       => drop;
                                       otherwise => accept }]],
                default = "accept" }
```

With this change, you should see 36 accepted packets and 17 dropped packets with
the pcap file from earlier.

## Making the firewall more realistic

So far, our firewall only works with capture files and not real traffic coming in
from a NIC. If you have a test machine with two NICs, you can replace the packet reader
and writers with apps that connect to the NICs (assuming you have some Intel 10G NICs
or another NIC supported by Snabb).

First, you will need an additional module import at the top:

```lua
local driver = require("apps.intel.intel_app").driver
```

This imports `intel_driver` app which is used to receive and send
packets for an Intel 10G NIC. The idea is to replace the `net1`
and `net2` app instances from before with the Intel app.

Note: if you don't have a supported NIC, you can also test this with
the [RawSocket](https://snabbco.github.io/#rawsocket-app-apps.socket.raw)
app which uses a kernel-managed network interface. Just replace the
above line with:

```lua
local driver = require("apps.socket.raw").RawSocket
```

The new app config declarations should look like this:

```lua
-- replace the pciaddr field with the appropriate result
-- use 'lspci' to see what your PCI addresses are
config.app(c, "net1", driver, { pciaddr = "81:00.0" })
config.app(c, "net2", driver, { pciaddr = "82:00.0" })
```

(For `RawSocket`, the third argument should be a string for the network
 interface, e.g., `"eth0"`)

The Intel driver takes a PCI address as a mandatory argument to specify the
appropriate NIC. There are also other arguments that you can supply which are
detailed in the [API docs](https://snabbco.github.io/#configuration).

The link declarations also need to change, because the Intel app uses
different names (`tx` and `rx`) from the pcap apps. The new links
look like this:

```lua
config.link(c, "net1.tx -> scanner.south")
config.link(c, "scanner.north -> firewall.input")
config.link(c, "firewall.output -> net2.rx")
config.link(c, "firewall.reject -> net2.rx")
```

With that change, you should be able to filter packets from the first NIC to
the second using the firewall app. You can run the program like this:

```
sudo ./snabb example_firewall
```

without any arguments since we are no longer passing in file paths.

### Filtering packets in the other direction

You may have noticed that the current firewall configuration only filters packets
going in one direction: from the first NIC to the second. There's a good chance,
however, that you will also wish to scan and filter outbound packets going out of
the network.

To set that up, you will need two instances of the `L7Fw` app, one for each
direction of traffic. On the other hand, you will only need one `L7Spy` since
it is set up for bidirectional packet flows.

The setup looks like this:

```lua
-- with the
config.app(c, "net1", driver, { pciaddr = "81:00.0" })
config.app(c, "net2", driver, { pciaddr = "82:00.0" })

-- Set up two firewalls this time
config.app(c, "scanner", spy.L7Spy, { scanner = s })
config.app(c, "firewall1", fw.L7Fw, fw_config)
config.app(c, "firewall2", fw.L7Fw, fw_config)

-- Incoming packets
config.link(c, "net1.tx -> scanner.south")
config.link(c, "scanner.north -> firewall1.input")
config.link(c, "firewall1.output -> net2.rx")
config.link(c, "firewall1.reject -> net2.rx")

-- Outgoing packets
config.link(c, "net2.tx -> scanner.north")
config.link(c, "scanner.south -> firewall2.input")
config.link(c, "firewall2.output -> net1.rx")
config.link(c, "firewall2.reject -> net1.rx")
```

Note that the two firewall app instances use the same set of rules. You may wish
to configure them so that the rules are different based on the direction of traffic,
in which case you can just specify different rule tables for each instance.

## Wrapping up

With those last changes, the example program is getting close to what a
realistic deployment of <span class="appname">Snabbwall</span> might look like.
There are a few aspects that would need adjustment for a real deployment.

For example, you may wish to adjust the invocation of `engine.main`
to remove the `duration` argument so that the firewall runs indefinitely.

To aid in debugging, it may be desirable to log actions to the system
log. To enable logging for the `L7Fw` app set the `logging` key in
`fw_config` to `"on"`. This will log dropped packets to the system log.

If you would like to hack on the Snabbwall apps themselves, the source code is
available in the [src/apps/wall](https://github.com/Igalia/snabb/tree/snabbwall/src/apps/wall)
directory. Please feel free to file any bug reports or pull requests via
the [Github page](https://github.com/Igalia/snabb/tree/snabbwall).
