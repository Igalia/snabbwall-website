We have completed the sixth and final development milestone of
<span class="appname">SnabbWall</span>, which is to upstream the
app to the main Snabb repository.

With this update, we have moved the official Snabbwall branch to
[`Igalia/snabb`][snabbwall] on Github in the `snabbwall` branch.
Any further updates will be made to this branch and will be periodically
upstreamed to the [`snabbco/snabb`][snabb] repository.

There is a blog post with a few more details [here][m6-blog-post]. Thanks
to the NLNet Foundation for sponsoring this project!
