After a small hiatus, work on <span class="appname">SnabbWall</span> is
progressing steadily again: the `L7Spy` Snabb application and the `snabb wall
spy` command, which can be used to scan network traffic and detect L7 data
flows, have landed in the repository. Our main developer has [written a
lengthy post][post-l7spy] about these features, which completes the third
milestone of the [development roadmap]({{< ref "roadmap.md" >}}).

The [ljndpi][ljndpi] FFI binding has received updates as well. Starting with
[version 0.0.3][ljndpi003], it can be used with nDPI 1.8; and in order to ease
adoption of `ljndpi` by projects other than <span
class="appname">SnabbWall</span>, the module has been [uploaded to the
LuaRocks repository][ljndpi-rocks]. For more details, you can read
[Adri√°n's article on this topic][post-ljndpi003].
