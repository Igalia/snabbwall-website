Igalian [Asumu Takikawa](https://www.asumu.xyz/) has completed the next
development milestone of <span class="appname">SnabbWall</span>. This means
that the `L7fw` application is now
[available](https://github.com/aperezdc/snabb/blob/snabbwall/src/apps/wall/l7fw.lua#L38),
as well as a `snabb wall filter` command, which can be readily used. With
these additions, the fourth development milestone of our [development
roadmap]({{< ref "roadmap.md" >}}) is now completed. Make sure to check out
Asumu's complete [writeup about the new features][m4-blog-post].

We have also started using the [project
wiki](https://github.com/aperezdc/snabb/wiki) to write down some technical
information for developers wanting to use the
<span class="appname">SnabbWall</span> components in their Snabb applications,
or looking into contributing to the project.
