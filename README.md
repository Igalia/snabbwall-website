You will need the [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) static website generator to preview your edits. Once installed, run it as a local web server:

```
hugo server -w
```

It will print an URL in the console that you can open in your browser to preview the website locally. The web server watches for changes in the file system, and therefore it is not needed to re-run it after every change.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, send us a pull request.
